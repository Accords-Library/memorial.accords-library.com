        Dearest Recorders and Observers of Accord's Library.<br /><br />

        These past few years have been a pleasure, but we regret to inform you
        all that we've been contacted by the Square Enix's Legal Team. And after
        some private communications, based on the outlined requirements we have
        come to the conclusion that Accord's Library must close its doors. While
        we are sad to have to go, we also must respect the wishes of the Legal
        Team.<br /><br />

        We hope to continue spending time with you all, and other fans in the
        future through our <a href="/discord">Discord server</a>, which we are
        keeping opened.<br /><br />

        On behalf of the entire Council for Accord's Library, we sincerely thank
        you for your support and friendship over the years. We hope that you
        will continue to use the Discord, though we understand if this is where
        we part ways.<br /><br />

        From the very bottom of our hearts, we will be forever grateful to
        everyone who's volunteered their time to help build Accord's Library
        into what it was. Thank you to all of our Transcribers, Translators, and
        most of all, all of you for sticking with us. Take care of yourselves
        out there. <br /><br />

        Glory to Mankind.<br /><br />

    <div id="message" class="font-m">
      We still own the domain name until July 2025 so we were thinking about
      hosting this memorial page until then.
      <br /><br />

      If there is any message, tweet, or artworks you would like to share here
      you can submit it on our Discord server on the <code>#memorial</code> channel.
      <br /><br />

      Artworks can be anything DrakeNieR / Yoko Taro related (although we think
      would be quite fitting to give Accord some love). If you submit a message
      or an artwork, please indicate what name you want to be credited under and
      optionally a link to your social page or blog.

          Thank you to those who worked hard to organize the website. I was able
          to learn so much about the world that I love! I&#39;m still a new
          artist, so this piece is quite rough, but I put a lot of love into
          drawing it. In the future when I&#39;m a much better artist, I&#39;d
          love to redraw it
